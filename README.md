1. usb needs to be formatted as fat32 type c
2. after formatting the stick, don't forget to run mkfs.vfat
3. all the folders and the files need to be owned by root user and group
4. just run the script as root user
5. using ix2-200d_images directory doesn't work and had to change the path to ix2-200_images
